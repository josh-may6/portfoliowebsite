I've developed a dynamic and visually appealing portfolio/resume website using Python, Flask, and Bootstrap technologies. The integration of Flask ensures a robust backend, while Bootstrap enhances the front-end with a responsive and user-friendly design. The website features a clean and organized presentation of my professional background, skills, and projects. A prominent contact form, seamlessly integrated into the site, allows visitors to easily reach out. Notably, the contact form is equipped with SMS functionality, enabling instant notifications for efficient communication. The backend is designed with security in mind, and the website's structure follows SEO best practices for better visibility. The result is a comprehensive and modern web presence that showcases my skills and achievements, prioritizes user experience, and allows for easy future expansion and updates.
